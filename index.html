<P>Scope essentially means where these
    variables are available for use.
     <b>#Var</b> declarations are globally 
    scoped or function/locally scoped.
    The scope is global when a var 
    variable is declared outside a function.
     This means that any variable that is 
     declared with var outside a
    function block is available for use 
    in the whole window</P>
